    "content": "With 1000 features and 500,000 points, you have a 500:1 data-to-feature ratio, which is generally good for avoiding overfitting. However, it depends on: - **Algorithm choice**: Linear models should work well; complex models (deep neural networks) may still overfit - **Feature relevance**: Many irrelevant features can cause overfitting - **Use"

    "content": "Overfitting can still occur with 1000 features and 500,000 points due to:\n\n1. **Curse of dimensionality**: High-dimensional spaces make data sparse, creating misleading patterns\n2. **Irrelevant features**: Many features may be noise, causing the model to learn false correlations\n3. **Complex models**: Deep networks or ensemble methods can still memorize noise despite large datasets\n4. **Feature interactions**: 1000 features create millions of potential interactions to overfit to\n5. **Data quality**: If data has systematic biases or errors, more data amplifies these issues\n\nThe 500:1 ratio helps but doesn't guarantee against overfitting, especially with noisy or irrelevant features."
